# What it does
  - The data is being fetched twice, once for the current temperature, once for the following 5 days
  - When the data is fetched for today it is sent to the weather.js file where then is taken in as corrected data and ultimately presented on the screen

  - When the 5 day forecast data is taken it is sent to the same file and it is presented in its own cards so it could be distinguished
  - The icons are connected based on the temperature that is being taken.
